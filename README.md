Model-based value iteration and policy iteration algorithms and the model-free Q-learning algorithm are employed to investigate and explore two interesting Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). One of the MDPs is the classic grid-world problem entitled Frozen Lake and another one is the traditional non-grid world problem entitled Forest Management.
